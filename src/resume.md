### Skills

I'm familiar with most current industry tooling and framework choices such as _TypeScript_, _React_, _Svelte_, module bundlers (_Webpack_, _Rollup_, _Parcel_), _GraphQL_, and the great majority of _HTML_ and _CSS_ pre/post-processors. I'm also an advocate for readable, clean code and show it through my constant efforts of standardizing coding styles and knowledge sharing.

My peers usually think I'm easy-going, communicative, a fast learner, and a reference for CSS and JavaScript knowledge. I'm also familiar with agile methodologies, interviewing, and managing open-source projects and small communities.
